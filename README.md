### Day 1 - 04/01/2025

Coming back to this after a short break to do my Misac App. The only real change I made was to give the correct name for OpenInventor, the viewer library I worked with at Theorem

The rest of the day was spent making updates to my LinkedIn and looking for ideas on how to structure my portfolio website. I found a repository with a massive collection of portfolios and clicking through at random happened upon a colleague of a friend, who had a wonderfully structured site (https://mattfiler.co.uk/). I've not got the body of work to compare, but it gave me a few ideas going forward.

Next Step: Put together a colour scheme for the portfolio site and use that to create a banner/LinkedIn background.

### Day 2 - 05/01/2025

Wrestled with GIMP for an hour or so to put together a very basic cover/header and it's now shoved on LinkedIn and used in this Portfolio site. I generated my colour scheme via https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/, using analogous colours to build a nice set. I ended up darkening the main colour for the background to my site as the initial one was too bright for bright text and too dark for dark text. 

I then tried adding in a Router, which immediately broke the site. During my attempts to fix it I discovered that React had moved up a version in December, which I'm sure will come in handy later. I also discovered that I was an idiot and was using npm install react-router-dom a directory further up than I should have, which lead me to a very quick solution.

Next Step: Expand the navigation bar to point to different parts of my biography (weird calling it that).

### Day 3 - 06/01/2025

I've done a lot of routing towards the various sub-pages, now there are nav bars within nav bars. I've also started the process of recording quick demo videos (and I've added the first into Home Page as a thumbnail for my BBSRecipe project)

Next Step: Moar demo videos

### Day 4 - 07/01/2025

Recording demo videos has given me a new appreciation for the role that QA plays in the development process. Can't believe how many bugs I'd missed...

None of the bugs I found were actually that bad, and I did get a good amount of footage for the little videos that my brain is telling me will definitely be a good idea to have in my breakdown (hah) of my recipe app. I'm sure I'm not the only one, but I do find that kind of video editing draining, especially when I'm trying to consider how best to show off a feature and hey look it's recording and I suddenly can't type or spell. I know never to do maths when recording, but apparently the same applies to spelling Celsius.
No actual code on portfolio site today, but hopefully I'll be able to get to integrating my vids tomorrow.

Next Step: Finish demo videos, begin integrating with text feature explanation

### Day 5 - 08/01/2025

Finished off recording the demo videos with far fewer incidents than yesterday. I was also able to start getting some code (or html and css) in, with a feature breakdown and some nice reactive transitions. I've not finished doing the written breakdown/discusson of the features yet, so that will come in tomorrow, hopefully.

Next Step: Finish feature descriptions, then work on Recipe Project: Thoughts

### Day 6 - 09/01/2025

Short day - finished off the descriptions for the feature demo videos and added a little styling to the Recipe Project Thoughts page.

Next Step: Start doing the same for Misac

### Day 7...ish - 14/01/2025

I've been feeling unwell the past few days so I'll fold what little progress I made before today into "day 7"

Recorded feature videos for Misac and fixed a couple of styling issues within that project.

Created a Recipe Project Summary page and moved Thoughts and Features pages a level lower so there was a distinct hierarchy of Projects->Recipe Project->Summary/Features/Thoughts rather than leaving them all in the projects navigation bar.

Added Misac thumbnail to the home page and listed the technologies it used
