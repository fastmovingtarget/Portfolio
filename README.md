### Day 1 - 04/01/2025

Coming back to this after a short break to do my Misac App. The only real change I made was to give the correct name for OpenInventor, the viewer library I worked with at Theorem

The rest of the day was spent making updates to my LinkedIn and looking for ideas on how to structure my portfolio website. I found a repository with a massive collection of portfolios and clicking through at random happened upon a colleague of a friend, who had a wonderfully structured site (https://mattfiler.co.uk/). I've not got the body of work to compare, but it gave me a few ideas going forward.

Next Step: Put together a colour scheme for the portfolio site and use that to create a banner/LinkedIn background.
