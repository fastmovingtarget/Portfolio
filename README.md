### Day 1 - 04/01/2025

Coming back to this after a short break to do my Misac App. The only real change I made was to give the correct name for OpenInventor, the viewer library I worked with at Theorem

The rest of the day was spent making updates to my LinkedIn and looking for ideas on how to structure my portfolio website. I found a repository with a massive collection of portfolios and clicking through at random happened upon a colleague of a friend, who had a wonderfully structured site (https://mattfiler.co.uk/). I've not got the body of work to compare, but it gave me a few ideas going forward.

Next Step: Put together a colour scheme for the portfolio site and use that to create a banner/LinkedIn background.

### Day 2 - 05/01/2025

Wrestled with GIMP for an hour or so to put together a very basic cover/header and it's now shoved on LinkedIn and used in this Portfolio site. I generated my colour scheme via https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/, using analogous colours to build a nice set. I ended up darkening the main colour for the background to my site as the initial one was too bright for bright text and too dark for dark text. 

I then tried adding in a Router, which immediately broke the site. During my attempts to fix it I discovered that React had moved up a version in December, which I'm sure will come in handy later. I also discovered that I was an idiot and was using npm install react-router-dom a directory further up than I should have, which lead me to a very quick solution.

Next Step: Expand the navigation bar to point to different parts of my biography (weird calling it that).

### Day 3 -
