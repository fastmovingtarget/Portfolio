            <p id="early-history" >I was born in Colchester, going to Primary School at Littlegarth Private School and the Dedham Primary School before moving to Philip Morant School for my secondary education.

                The GCSEs I studied during this time were Science (double), Maths, Statistics, Geography, History, Religious Education (half), German, English Language and Literature (double), I.T. and Product Design
                passing with the eventual grades A,A,A,A,A,A,A,B,B,B,C,C,C respectively.

                After my GCSEs I moved to the Colchester Royal Grammar School 6th form college and chose to study Maths, Physics, Chemistry and History, eventually getting B grades at A2 for all and a C for the mandatory General Studies A2.
