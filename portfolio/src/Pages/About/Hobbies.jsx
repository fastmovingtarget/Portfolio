            <ul id="hobbies" >
                <li>Reading: I've enjoyed reading for as long as I can remember, and it's fair to say that it's the most prevalent influence in my life. My primary preference is the Fantasy genre, as I enjoy seeing characters
                    being placed under stresses and pressures that we wouldn't see in reality, but thinking upon those reactions and what's believeable and what isn't illuminates human nature from a different angle that I find fascinating.
                    I'm not sure a fantasy lover can avoid Brandon Sanderson's works these days, but other works I've enjoyed include (in no particular order): Wheel of Time, Riftwar, Realm of the Elderlings, Cradle, Foundation, Dune, 
                    Dresden Files, 2/3 of Kingkiller, Suneater, Lord of the Rings (of course), Discworld (of course of course), Earthsea, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
                </li>
                <li>Computer Games: Another very early influence - I remember watching my brother and father playing games like the original Dune 2 and Discworld back when I was too small to reach a keyboard. To this day I've maintained my 
                    love of strategy games, following down their branching paths to 4X games like Civilization and Stellaris, MOBAs like Dota 2, city builders and simulation games like Against the Storm and Banished and automation games like Factorio, 
                    Dyson Sphere Program and Satisfactory. Unsurprisingly enough, given my love of reading, I also love the more story-heavy RPG series like Final Fantasy, Tales, Persona as well as western titles like Mass Effect, 
                    Elder Scrolls and Baldur's Gate.
                </li>
                <li>Circus Skills and Performance: Shortly after enrolling into the University of Birmingham I joined the Circus Society at the behest of my friends. The primary focus of this society was in teaching street performance techniques revolving around
                    object manipulation, including activities like juggling (with balls, clubs and silks...as well as most other things that can fit in a hand), cigar boxes, contact juggling, plate spinning and similar techniques.
                    I also learned showier skills centered around fire spinning performances, involving poi, whip, club juggling (again) and most importantly for me, staff. Staff spinning quickly became my primary specialty in the 
                    society, and after a couple of years I ended up as the primary instructor and most skilled performer. I found myself initially uncomfortable with performing, as my natural shyness came to the fore, and for my initial 
                    few gigs I had to be gently peer-pressured into performing. Eventually, as my confidence in my own skills grew, I was able to overcome my performance nerves and ended up spinning flawlessly in front of hundreds of people
                    at a University American Football game.
                </li>
                <li>Tai-chi: During my second year in Birmingham, I began attending a Tai-chi class run by the Grandmaster-elect of the Northern Wu style. Learning traditional Tai-chi not only improved my fitness and flexibility, it also
                    increased my knowledge of biomechanics, my mental discipline and my confidence. I eventually reached a point where I was able to scare off an attempted mugger by simply refusing to be intimidated. As I grew in skill, I 
                    began taking on more teaching responsibilities within the class, even while learning techniques and forms from similar martial arts like Baguazhang, Xingyiquan and Bajiquan. 
                    
                    I eventually reached the point where I was asked to take charge of the class when my teacher moved to London, although at that point membership had begun to reduce enough that it was uneconomic to continue the class further
                    and after much discussion and sadness I made the decision to close the class down.
