                <p>Hello, my name is James and I'm a software developer. I graduated University with degrees in Physics and Computer Science, then worked as a Software Developer at Theorem Solutions for 4 years, using C, C++, C#, .NET and Java 
                    before eventually leaving to give myself opportunities to grow as a person and as a programmer. Since then I've moved my skills towards Web Development with Javascript, React and nodejs.
